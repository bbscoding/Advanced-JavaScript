# Advanced JavaScript Examples

This repository demonstrates core JavaScript concepts with practical examples:

1. **Lexical Scope & Closure**  
   - Functions can access variables from their parent scope.  
   - Closures allow a function to "remember" these variables even after the parent scope is gone.  

2. **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**  
   - Functions that run immediately after being defined.  
   - Useful for creating private variables and avoiding global scope pollution.  

3. **Closure with Parameters**  
   - Demonstrates how closures can manage dynamic values (like credits, counters, API limits).  
   - Useful for state management and resource control.
